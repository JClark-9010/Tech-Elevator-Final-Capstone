# Final Capstone

My final Capstone Project at TE. Great experience! I wish we could've done more but I am happy with what we accomplished. I worked with a team of 2 others. We worked in an Agile environment, had daily scrum meetings, worked in 3 day sprints, completed work using MOB, pair, and individual programming.
